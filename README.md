# React Native Pong Wars 📱

Hey there! Welcome to my little corner of the internet where day battles night in the ultimate showdown: Pong Wars. This is my weekend project, brought to life with some awesome tech: [@shopify/react-native-skia](https://github.com/shopify/react-native-skia) and [Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/), so everything runs 120/60 fps 🚀. I had a blast making it, and I hope you enjoy diving into it as much as I did.

## Development 🛠

Contributions are super welcome. Just one small request: let's keep the game simple and fun.

## How to Run 🏃‍♂️

It's set up as a basic Expo project. Install deps `npm install` and then just use `npm run ios` or `npm run android` to get the ball rolling.

## Shoutouts 📣

Huge shoutout to [vnglst](https://github.com/vnglst) for sparking the idea and for the [original source code](https://github.com/vnglst/pong-wars) that inspired this project.
